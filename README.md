# MLOPS-SCHITTVISION

Welcome to **SchittVision**, your emotionally adaptive chatbot inspired by the beloved characters of *Schittâ€™s Creek*! This project combines state-of-the-art NLP and deep learning models with solid MLOps practices to deliver a chatbot that not only talks but *feels* like the characters you love.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The first version of SchittVision was built as a prototype without formal MLOps practices, mostly using notebooks and scattered scripts. To improve reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability, this repository represents a fresh start â€” a full rebuild with integrated MLOps practises.

SchittVision is designed to:
- Recognize and respond to emotional cues in conversations.
- Generate witty, context-aware responses inspired by Schittâ€™s Creek characters.
- Track data, experiments, and model versions using MLOps tools.
- Be deployed and scaled easily with containerization and CI/CD pipelines.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Emotionally adaptive chatbot powered by transformer-based NLP models.
- Robust data versioning and pipeline management with DVC.
- Experiment tracking and model registry with MLflow.
- Modular, maintainable codebase following best practices.
- API for chatbot interaction built with Flask/FastAPI.
